# Privacy & Security Posture

- **Zero-upload**: Documents never leave the device.
- **Local compute**: Parsing, detection, redaction, and export all in-browser.
- **Offline capable**: Works without network once installed.
- **No content analytics**: We do not transmit or store document content.
- **User Control**: All state stored in IndexedDB; user can clear cache.
- **Optional Sync (future)**: end-to-end encrypted, opt-in.
