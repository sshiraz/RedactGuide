# Components Directory

This directory contains shared, reusable UI components.

## Purpose

Generic, presentational components that can be used across multiple features.

## Component Types

### Layout Components

- Header, Footer, Container, Grid
- Responsive wrappers and containers

### UI Elements

- Buttons, Inputs, Cards, Modals
- Form controls and feedback elements

### Feedback Components

- Loading spinners and progress bars
- Error messages and alerts
- Toast notifications
- Empty states

### Navigation Components

- Links, Breadcrumbs
- Navigation menus

## Guidelines

- Components should be presentational (minimal business logic)
- Accept props for customization
- Use TypeScript interfaces for prop types
- Follow naming convention: PascalCase for component files
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Document complex components with JSDoc or comments
- Consider accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
